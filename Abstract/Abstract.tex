Online examinations have become essential in modern education, but ensuring academic integrity remains challenging. Traditional manual proctoring is resource-intensive and expensive. This project presents an AI-powered online exam proctoring platform that addresses these challenges through automated real-time monitoring.

The platform leverages YOLOv8n for object detection and MediaPipe for facial analysis to monitor student behavior during examinations. It employs a dual-camera architecture using WebRTC technology, capturing desktop and mobile camera feeds simultaneously. Real-time alerts are delivered via Socket.IO with latency under 150ms.

The platform provides automated MCQ grading, manual grading interface for descriptive questions, and a violation detection system that automatically bans students exceeding five violations. Built on React.js, Flask, and MySQL, the platform ensures security through JWT authentication and HTTPS/TLS encryption, complying with GDPR, CCPA, and FERPA regulations. Performance analysis demonstrates 82\% cost reduction compared to manual proctoring.
